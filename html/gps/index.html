<!-- Reflection:

1. The purpose of html5 semantic tags is to aid in machine-readable organization of a page. Good usage of semantic elements makes screen readers much more effective, provides better organization and potential results from search engines, and makes code more understandable to other developers that may work on it down the road. So far, I can see the article, section, and main elements being the most useful.

2. As far as I can understand this question, the browser will display elements on a page in the order they are laid out in the html file. Semantic elements are giving extra meaning to parts of a web page, but it is still up to the developer to organize a page meaningfully and use semantic elements appropriately.

3. I learned that Sublime can be a very powerful and useful piece of software for working with code. Code snippets can be a very handy feature, and our guide also taught us a few really useful key shortcuts for sublime during this session. I can definitely see myself creating some more snippets in the future once I come across some more good potential uses for them.

4. The thing I struggled with the most this session was understanding when to use and how best to employ the semantic elements, but I think this is mostly arising from the fact that I have not yet used them meaningfully when creating a web page. I think this will come to me pretty quickly once I get into more practice with building web sites and using these elements. -->
