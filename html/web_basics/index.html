  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>I have never had a cat as a pet, but I suppose it's worth a shot. I've always had dogs growing up and am <strong>definitely</strong> a dog person. I'd rather not start a <em>cats</em> vs. <em>dogs</em> argument at this time though!</p>
  <p>3 Reasons Why I love dogs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Personality</li>
      <li>Companionship</li>
      <li>Running Partner</li>
    </ol>
  <p>A few reasons I haven't given cats a shot yet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I feel the level of companionship offered is not even close to that of dogs.</li>
      <li>I don't like the thought of an animal climbing all over my home and breaking things. (I know dogs can do this too, but I'm used to that!</li>
    </ul>
