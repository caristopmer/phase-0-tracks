## Challenge 9.1 Release 1

What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* The Linux OS offers the user a far greater level of control over their machine. A key philosophy with the Linux OS is that the user is competent with their computer and knows what they are doing. Instead of going out of its way to confirm you understand the consequences of every command you enter, it just lets you do them. This makes the user very powerful, but can also be very dangerous if the user does not, in fact, know what they are doing.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

* A VPS is basically an artificial computer that lives in a block of memory on another, real and physical, computer. It behaves the same way as a physical web server; but runs within the memory of a physical web server or computer. The main advantages are they are much easier to set up and configure, and as a result come at a much lower cost to their dedicated physical counterparts.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

* Running programs as the root user means that those programs also have the privileges of the root user. Programs will have the ability to manipulate files in what could be a destructive way. By running programs as a normal user, you must provide permissions for programs to access and do certain things, and the computer will be more protected from any program issues/crashes causing greater issues with the overall machine.
