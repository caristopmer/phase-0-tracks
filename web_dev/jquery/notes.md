## Learning jQuery

###How I plan to teach myself jQuery in 2 hours:

Watch a few 5-10 minute youtube tutorials on jQuery.

* I find videos are a great way for me to quickly learn a lot about a new concept.

Find a jQuery docs or equivalent website for future reference.

* Referencing the docs for languages has been very useful to me so far, so I would like to have some sort of equivalent resource for jQuery if it exists.

Find a jQuery cheat sheet on the web to save for reference.

* The cheat sheets we have found and utilized in this program so far have been invaluable.

Dabble around in the codecademy course on jQuery with my remaining time.

* While I feel codecademy isn't the best single resource to learn a new topic, I do like it for review and extra exposure to new concepts.

### After Research:

I felt all of my approaches were pretty effective in learning jQuery. The youtube tutorials were very valuable, I was able to find useful documentation and resources, and a spent a small amount of remaining time getting some light practice with codecademy.
